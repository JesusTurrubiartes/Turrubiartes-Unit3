<p>The 2015 Stingray is a very fast car, indeed. That 455-horsepower V-8 engine offers plenty of push to accelerate the car, hitting 0-60 mph in just 3.8 seconds—or even faster at 3.7 seconds with the new 8-speed automatic. Quarter mile times are a mere 11.9 seconds with the automatic, or 12.0 with the seven-speed manual. Whether tackling the straights or the curves, the Stingray offers ample performance, with surprising grip, nimble reflexes, and a great deal of communication through the seat, pedals, and steering wheel, all of which inspires driver confidence. A Z51 package is available to further enhance the Stingray’s performance. In Z06 trim, the manual version of the car can click of 3.2-second 0-60 mph runs, while the automatic is even quicker, clocking in at 2.95 seconds.
