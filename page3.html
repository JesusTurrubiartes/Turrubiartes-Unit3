<p>Here it is, flat out: the 2015 Dodge Charger SRT® Hellcat is the most powerful sedan ever.* A supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI® V8 Hellcat engine churns out 707 horsepower and uncorks 650 lb.-ft. of twist, mated to a revolutionary, segment-first TorqueFlite® 8-speed automatic transmission. This new transmission delivers fuel-efficient street driving and maximum performance track driving with 160 millisecond shifts and rev-matching downshifts. You’ll know a secret as you run errands or ferry the kids to school: the fastest quarter-mile time ever by a 4-door production car* is waiting to be unleashed at a moment’s notice.</p>
